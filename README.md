# vitasdk code samples

Every directory contains a single sample. To build all samples, add the toolchain `bin/` directory to your `$PATH`, then run `./build.sh`. To clean all samples, run `./clean.sh`. To build a single sample, `cd` to its directory and type `make`.

Always use the `*_debug.bat` (e.g. `run_homebrew_unity_debug.bat`) launcher to get debug output from Vita.

## List of samples
